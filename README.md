# TDD Showcase
This is a simple project to showcase a TDD-Workflow for a simple beginner workshop. It presents a small task/challenge and possible solutions step-by-step.

# Task

Write a chunking algorithm in a TDD-Workflow for simple lists. The API should look similar to this:

```python
def chunk(full_list: List[Any], chunksize: int) -> range:
    pass
```

One possible solution you find on the `solution`-branch or the tagged commits for the single steps.
